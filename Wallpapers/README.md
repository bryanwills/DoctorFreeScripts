     [Note: Wallbase has been shutdown. Use Wallhaven, its successor. See wh.]
     You will need to configure your own Wallbase username/password as well as
     extensively modify the favorites by both name and number so this script
     may not be that useful to others. Get MacEarl's original and do to it
     what I have done to this.

[**wh**](Wallpapers/wh.sh) - 

     You will need to configure your own Wallhaven username/password in the
     script. See the Wallhaven convenience scripts in the Wallpapers dir
     for easy bulk downloading.
