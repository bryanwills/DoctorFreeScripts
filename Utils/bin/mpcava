# mpcava - start two terminal emulators, one running ncmpcpp
#          and the other running cava.
#
# I am using two separate terminal emulators as I want a smaller
# font for the cava terminal. The terminal command options are
# customized for my setup, you may need to adjust the geometry
# to get the two windows to align as desired. I wanted the cava
# terminal window at the bottom of the screen and aligned with
# the ncmpcpp terminal window. Couldn't figure out how to set
# the window title for gnome-terminal.
#
# In addition, this assumes a "SmallFont" profile has been created
# in gnome-terminal. I used a size 8 font for the cava terminal window.
# The geometry settings here align the two windows well, the ncmpcpp
# window using a size 32 font.
